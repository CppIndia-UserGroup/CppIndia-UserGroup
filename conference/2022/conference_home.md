CppIndiaCon - The C++ festival of India is back!  

CppIndiaCon is India's premier International Conference hosted by the [CppIndia](/_pages/about_us){:target="_blank"} community. CppIndia is excited to announce the 2nd edition of this International Conference on **6th August 2022**.

For our inaugural conference last year, we had talks from the greats of C++, including [Bjarne Stroustrup](/conference/2021/speakers/bjarne/), [Bryce Lelbach](/conference/2021/speakers/bryce/), and [Jon Kalb](/conference/2021/speakers/jonkalb/).

Like last year, CppIndiaCon 2022 shall be a **free online conference** despite the high quality talks from industry experts. Attending requires registration.
