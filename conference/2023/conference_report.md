CppIndia is a dynamic community that thrives on the shared love for C++, providing a welcoming space for developers to learn, collaborate, and engage in insightful discussions about the language. Our vision is to cultivate an ecosystem that connects C++ developers and companies, serving as a go-to hub for all their C++ related queries and requirements. 

As we stride forward in our mission to strengthen the C++ community, I am delighted to share with you the remarkable success of CppIndiaCon 2023, our third international C++ conference in India. This conference embodies the spirit of innovation and knowledge exchange, uniting C++ enthusiasts from across the country and beyond. 

Join me as I take you on a captivating journey, reflecting on the meticulous planning that went into making CppIndiaCon 2023 a resounding success. From its inception to the heartwarming interactions during the event, this blog will recount the experiences, appreciate the contributions, and envision the bright future that lies ahead for CppIndia and its passionate community of C++ developers. 

# Planning and Execution of CppIndiaCon 2023: A Journey to Success 
Like the previous iterations of CppIndiaCon, ***CppIndiaCon 2023*** proved to be a resounding success. This year, we undertook several trial runs to ensure a seamless experience. 

Our journey began in *January 2023*, with the first question revolving around the conference dates. It was clear that August was the month of choice. Aligning with CppIndia's birth date on August 15th, a date symbolic for our community, we aimed for this month. However, considering the Indian Independence Day on the same date, we decided to sidestep that week. With Raksha Bandhan, a significant festival in India, taking place on August 30th, that week was also marked off, eventually leading us to select the first week of August. 

Traditionally, our regular sessions and previous conferences were held on weekends. Contemplating hosting the conference on a weekday was met with uncertainty. We weighed the potential drawbacks of attendees being preoccupied with work or studies against the convenience of attending a virtual conference from home or office. This deliberation, while discussed within the team numerous times, yielded no definitive numbers in favor of either choice. 

Opting to take a chance, we decided on a Friday and Saturday event, scheduled for August 4th and 5th. With dates set, we delved into execution, dividing responsibilities among ourselves – I, Mahendra, and Ankur. We established web pages and speaker application forms on our website, initiating efforts to spread the word. The response was swift, with talk proposals flowing in. 

In the months of May and June, we put out a call for volunteers, and the response from our community was fantastic as people eagerly filled out the form. With *22 enthusiastic volunteers* registering, we kicked off our work, joining forces with both our returning volunteers from the previous year and the fresh faces who were joining the team for the first time. 

Utilizing **Zoom** as the platform of choice for the conference and leveraging the CppIndia Discord server for networking, we explored Discord Stage for post-talk Q&A, which turned out to be a successful addition. One observation was that transitioning between Zoom and Discord wasn't as seamless as desired, prompting the search for an improved solution for future virtual events. 

This year saw over 20 talk proposals, a notable increase from prior conferences. In mid-April, we meticulously evaluated each proposal, meticulously curating the final talks that would shape the conference content. ([CppIndiaCon 2023 Schedule](https://www.cppindia.co.in/conference/2023/schedule/)) 

Registrations opened in March, and the response was heartening. A total of 577 individuals registered for CppIndiaCon 2023, with the breakdown as follows: 

**Total Registrations: 577** 

**Day 1** Total Users: 423 <br>
**Day 2** Total Users: 194
