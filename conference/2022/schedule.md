| :------------- | :-----------:   |:----:|:----|
| 10:00 - 10:30 |  **Introduction** | CppIndia Hosts | Welcome, familiarisation with the conference setup and Networking tools.
| 10:30 - 11:30 |  **C++ Today: The Beast is Back** | [Jon Kalb](/conference/2021/speakers/jonkalb/) | This presentation will cover why engineers looking for performance choose C++. This talk will present a historical perspective of C++ focusing on what’s going on in the C++ community right now and where the language and its user base is heading. With a renewed interest in performance for both data centers and mobile devices, and the success of open source software libraries, C++ is back and it is hot.<br><br>This presentation will explain why C++ is most software engineers' go-to language for performance. You will receive a rough historical sketch that puts C++ in perspective and covers its popularity ups and downs. This talk is based, in part, on the book "**C++ Today: The Beast is Back**" published by O’Reilly. |
| 11:30 - 11:45 |  15 min Break & Networking |  | 
| 11:45 - 12:45 |  **What belongs in the C++ Standard Library** | [Bryce Adelstein Lelbach](/conference/2021/speakers/bryce/) | What belongs in the C++ Standard Library? Should it be large and all encompassing? Or should it be small and focused? For decades, the C++ community and committee has struggled with this question.<br><br>In this talk, Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, the chair of C++'s Library Evolution group will present his answer to the question and the principles that he believes should guide stewardship of the C++ Standard Library. |
| 12:45 - 13:00 |  15 min Break & Networking |  | 
| 13:00 - 14:00 |  **C++20 Ranges: Code expressively with Ranges** | [Harishankar Singh](/conference/2021/speakers/harishankar/) | This talk will start with short introduction with Ranges. The focus will be on  how Ranges can change the way you write code in C++. Write Complex Problems/Algorithms in more expressive way in C++ with Ranges using some examples. |
| 14:00 - 14:45 |  Lunch & Networking | | 
| 14:45 - 15:45 |  **C++20 concepts - The Base Classes of Generic Programming? Or Not?** | [Ankur Satle](/conference/2021/speakers/ankur/) | C++20 introduced `concept`s. One may draw an analogy between `concept` of the Generic Programming world and Base Classes of the well-known OOP world. It is but natural to start with what we know. But are they really similar? In what ways? In what ways are they dissimilar? <br><br>This talk:<br>(1) Briefly outlines what `concept`s are,<br>(2) **Compares and contrasts `concept`s with the Base Class parallel**,<br>(3) Presents some guidelines on working with `concept`s.<br><br>By the end of the talk, we will learn whether `concept`s match up what we have come to expect off Base Classes. And, what more they offer. How we can achieve similar levels of abstraction as compared to polymorphism and much more. We also discuss some surprises. |
| 15:45 - 16:00 |  15 min Break & Networking |  | 
| 16:00 - 17:00 |  **Contract Programming : What, Why, and How?** | [Saurabh Joshi](/conference/2021/speakers/saurabhjoshi/) | Software has penetrated almost every aspect of our lives, from our washing machines to cars, from airplanes to medical devices.  As a programmer, would you use an insulin pump or a pacemaker for which you have written the program that drives it?<br><br>How, as a programmer, can you ensure that nothing would go wrong? This talk will talk about what code contracts are and why they are extremely important. Talk will discuss how contracts along with contract checkers can make our world a safer place. It will discuss aspects of static time contract checking versus runtime contract checking. Later this talk will discuss code contracts in the context of C++ along with a few examples. |
| 17:00 - 17:15 |  15 min Break & Networking |  | 
| 17:15 - 18:15 |  **AMA With Bjarne Stroustrup** | [Bjarne Stroustrup](/conference/2021/speakers/bjarne/) | Ask Bjarne Anything! If it is C++, you can ask him about it. |
| 18:15 - 18:30 |  **Closing** | | 
| 18:15 - Drop Dead |  **Networking** | |
