## Rules

### Session Timer: 
Once the hackathon session starts, the timer will begin. Please note that the time allotted for the session is fixed and cannot be extended.

### Session Joining:
You have the flexibility to leave the session in between and rejoin as needed. However, it's important to remember that the timer will continue running even if you temporarily exit the session. Please note that when you rejoin, it will start a new session, and you will lose your previous terminal session.

### Debugging Tools:
Participants are allowed to use any debugging tool of their choice, including gdb and udb. However, we highly recommend using UDB (Undo Debugging) for an optimized debugging experience.

### Closing the Session:
You have the freedom to close the session at any time during the hackathon if needed. Please ensure that you have completed the required tasks and submitted your final answer before closing the session.

### Submission of Answers:
Once you have completed the debugging task, please submit your final answer using the below provided form. It's crucial to submit your answer within the given timeframe. Failure to submit will result in your task being marked as incomplete.
