## think-cell

<!-- Would you like to know what it is like working as a [C++ developer](https://www.think-cell.com/cppindiacon){:target="_blank"} in a role with a <strong>highly competitive salary, life-style friendly hours</strong> and <strong>no deadlines or overtime</strong>?   -->

[think-cell](https://www.think-cell.com/en){:target="_blank"} is a fast-paced software company in Berlin, Germany, with a focus on developing graphics products that stand out from the crowd. More than 1,000,000 users worldwide rely on our software for their daily business because we make creating PowerPoint presentations so much easier, faster, and more enjoyable. Among our customers are many renowned consulting companies and large international corporations.

Our focus is on business slides (as opposed to more artful, open-ended applications) because they offer great potential for automation of the layout tasks traditionally performed by PowerPoint users themselves. There are plenty of challenges, from a solid understanding of what makes a good layout, to algorithms that produce an aesthetically pleasing output fast enough for interactive slide design, to an intuitive and unobtrusive user interface that supports our original approach to slide layout, to solid technical solutions for automatic bug reporting and updates, to compatibility with third-party software on the computers of over a million users.

We are looking for bright, creative C++ Developers with a solid theoretical background to join our engineering team. 

### Highlights of the role:

- We use the latest C++ features as soon as the compilers support them. 
- We take the time to deliver perfect code. We love refactoring and modernizing old code. 
- We prefer functional-style generic algorithms and ranges over imperative programming. 
- We’re not afraid of advanced template metaprogramming or macros when they avoid code duplication or lead to cleaner, more readable code. 
- We constantly introduce and improve our own libraries that go far beyond what the standard library has to offer. 
- If we have done something cool, we talk about it at C++ conferences. 
- If we are missing a C++ language feature, we write a proposal and present it to the C++ standard committee.

### Here is what we offer:

- A highly competitive salary from the start and a raise to EUR 130,000 annually after only one year
- Support with relocation to Berlin and an apartment for the first month
- Lifestyle-friendly working hours, no deadlines, no overtime!
- No scheduled meetings
- An international team of brilliant minds
- A flat organization with respectful colleagues and plenty of room for your ideas
- A working environment driven by the pursuit of excellence
