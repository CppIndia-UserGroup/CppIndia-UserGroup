2. Be Kind and Courteous. We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

3. No Hate Speech or Bullying. Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and derogatory comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

4. No Promotions or Spam Give more than you take from the community. Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed.

5. Respect Everyone's Privacy. Being part of this community requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make communities great, but may also be sensitive and private. What's shared in the community should stay in the community.
