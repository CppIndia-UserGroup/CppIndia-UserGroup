## [Click here to register.](/hackthon/hackathon-reg-form)

Welcome to the **Time Travel Debugging Hackathon 2023**, hosted by [**CppIndia**](www.cppindia.co.in) in association with [**Undo**](https://undo.io/){:target="_blank"}! We invite you to participate in this exciting event, which aims to bring together C++ communities from around the world to showcase their debugging skills and compete for amazing prizes.

The competition will be held on July 1st, 2023, and will be open to participants who have been nominated by their community managers. If you're interested in participating but haven't been nominated, don't worry! You can still fill out the registration form, and we will help you connect with the community in your area.

Each participant will represent their respective community and win a prize for themselves as well as their community. This will support the community and showcase the participant's efforts for their community. 

To ensure a fair and transparent competition, we have established some rules that all participants must adhere to. Here are the rules for the Time Travel Debugging competition:

1. **Eligibility**: Participants must be nominated by their community managers and must register for the competition [here](/hackthon/hackathon-reg-form).

2. **Nominations**: Each community manager can nominate a maximum of 5 participants to represent their community in the competition.

3. **Process Overview**:
    - Community managers will nominate their community members.
    - Nominated members will register [here](/hackthon/hackathon-reg-form).
    - Registered participants will receive an invitation to an introductory session providing an initial overview of the technology, competition, and process.
    - The introductory session will be conducted a week before.
    - Participants will also receive access to the Undo University course and labs for practice.
    - On the day of the competition, participants will join the competition.
    - Results will be announced after 1 week.

4. **Rewards**:
    - The winner of the competition will receive a **$100 gift card** in their local currency, **swag from Undo**, and a **6-month UDB licence**.
    - Additionally, the winner's community will receive a prize amount of **$250** to go towards their budget.
    - All participants will also receive a **60-day UDB licence** as a token of participation.

5. **Problem Statement**: Participants will be given one or two problem statements to debug within a time-bound environment during the competition.

6. **Time-Bound Environment:** The competition will be held within a time-bound environment, and participants will be given a fixed amount of time to solve the problem statements.

7. **Code of Conduct**: Participants are expected to adhere to a [code of conduct](/CodeOfConduct/codeofconduct) during the competition.

8. **Judges' Decision**: The judges' decision will be final and binding, and no correspondence will be entertained in this regard.

We hope these rules are clear and will help ensure a fair and enjoyable competition for all participants. Good luck, and we look forward to seeing you at the Time Travel Debugging competition!

We encourage community managers to share about this hackathon with community and nominate the best engineers for the competition. We believe that this competition will provide a unique platform for C++ communities to come together, share knowledge, and showcase their debugging skills.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and we look forward to your participation in the Time Travel Debugging competition.

# About [![Undo](/assets/images/hackathon/undo.png "Undo")](https://undo.io/){:target="_blank"}
## Building a world in which computers tell us exactly what they did and why
[Undo](https://undo.io/){:target="_blank"} is the time travel debugging company for Linux. We equip developers with the technology to understand complex code and fix bugs faster.

Developers spend far too much time figuring out what code actually does – either to understand other people’s code or to find and fix bugs. Debugging can be especially time-consuming when software failures cannot be reproduced. 

Time travel debugging solves this problem by making bugs 100% reproducible. By bringing time travel debugging to CI and System Test, Undo’s LiveRecorder enables developers to save time diagnosing the root causes of new regressions, legacy bugs, and flaky tests.

Thousands of developers across leading technology firms including SAP, Juniper Networks, and Siemens use LiveRecorder to improve developer productivity, development velocity, and software quality.
