CppIndiaCon - The C++ festival of India is back!  

CppIndiaCon is India's premier International Conference hosted by [CppIndia](/_pages/about_us). CppIndia is excited to announce the 2nd edition of this International Conference on **6th August 2022**.

For our inaugural conference last year, we had talks from the greats of C++, including [Bjarne Stroustrup](/conference/2021/speakers/bjarne/), [Bryce Lelbach](/conference/2021/speakers/bryce/), and [Jon Kalb](/conference/2021/speakers/jonkalb/). Do check out the [CppIndiaCon 2021 Speakers](/conference/2021/speakers/speakers/).

For CppIndiaCon 2022 too, we have an exciting line-up of talks by [Inbal Levi](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/), [Greg Law](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/), [Mahendra Garodi](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/) and [Ankur Satle](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/). Check out all about our favourite speakers on the [CppIndiaCon 2022 Speakers page](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/).

Like last year, CppIndiaCon 2022 shall be a **free online conference** despite the high quality talks from industry experts. Attending requires registration.

>To attend, please [register here](/conference/2022/CppIndiaCon-reg-form/){:target="_blank"}.

We are exploring the platform for the conference. Stay tuned to get updates.

This year's schedule has been improvised based on feedback from last year. As against six talks & AMAs in 2021, this year, we are going to have a single track of five talks. This enabled us to increase the Networking time between talks to 30-min, doubling it from CppIndiaCon 2021. The community shall greatly be benefitted by the intense topics at the tech-talks and the close networking opportunities that the conference brings.

>Check out the [CppIndiaCon 2022 Schedule](/conference/2022/schedule/).

Be prepared and try not to get stumped by the C++ trivia googlies that our [team of enthusiastic volunteers](/_pages/team) have prepared for you unsuspecting attendees! There shall be prizes to be won from our Gold Sponsors. Do check out their pages and their products.

Our Gold Sponsors will also have a table set-up during the conference for direct connect with the community. You may try out their products, solutions and offering. Have your resumes handy to make the most of the opportunity.

<!-- The conference will start at **10:00 AM IST**. Use this to check time in your [time zone](https://savvytime.com/converter/ist/aug-15-2021/10-00am){:target="_blank"}. -->

We look forward to attendees from all walks of life: including industry leaders, engineers, researchers, students or just interested or exploring. There will be a lot of networking opportunities, bumping into interesting people and learning & sharing from each other.

>We will be using [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Wz42tX5){:target="_blank"} for networking.
There will be many **voice and video tables**, open for you to join, discuss and screen-share with other members on the table.

<!--CppIndia also invites you to submit your talk for the CppIndiaCon 2022. Do capitalize on the chance to share the stage with renowned speakers and make an impact yourself!
