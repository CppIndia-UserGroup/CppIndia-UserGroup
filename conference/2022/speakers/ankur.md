**Ankur Satle** is an **Architect** working on **Telecom products** at [EXFO](https://www.exfo.com/){:target="_blank"}. He has extensively worked on **high-performance 3G/4G/5G/IMS/VoIP products, Network Monitoring, OSS/BSS** monolith & distributed systems in his 19+ years of experience. He is currently exploring some new technology to build a Smart Data Platform for 5G/4G/3G Service Assurance & Network Monitoring. 

He is a strong proponent of building functionality as build-once-and-use-everywhere libraries and building software capital on Open-source or InnerSource. He greatly values implementations that are `easy-to-use-correctly`, `correct-by-construction`, and `minimalistic-that-enables-change`. Distributed Architecture, Cloud Technologies and DevOps fascinate him. He holds a B. Tech. in Electronics and Telecom and a Post-graduate Diploma in Software Technology. An engineer at heart, he has a strong optimisation focus, using less resources and minimalism. No wonder, C++ is his favourite tool. He has a multi-codebase modernisation experience. 

He loves learning languages - natural languages :). He has a fair grip on a few Indian languages and is currently learning French. A father of two, he loves outdoor activities, drawing and talking about cosmology with children. He loves playing football and watching thrillers & mystery movies. He is constantly learning something or the other, you may often find. 

If you attended any CppIndia Tech-Talk, you will find him there hosting and sharing his thoughts. He is an active Organizer, Presenter and Maintainer at CppIndia. You can check out his talks from [Cppcon 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ji9iRq7JoE){:target="_blank"}, [Cppcon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUwDk5YW7Q){:target="_blank"} and CppIndia on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ankur+satle){:target="_blank"}.
