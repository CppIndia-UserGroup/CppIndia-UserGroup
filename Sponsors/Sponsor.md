## Why sponsor CppIndia

CppIndia has a long-term mission to serve the needs of C++ developers in India and we are interested in partnering with companies that share that long-term vision.
Supporting and sponsoring CppIndia delivers value to companies in our community in a number of ways.

### Value directly to companies that sponsor or have employees speak:

**Recruitment**: Nothing makes a company more attractive to community members when considering employment options than to see long-term community support as a sponsor and to see knowledgeable speakers from that company talking about tackling challenging issues in interesting ways.

**Image and awareness**: Members will gain a favorable impression of sponsoring companies and companies with knowledgeable employees speaking.

**Product exposure**: Swag opportunities and presentations expose members to new products and ideas.

**Community influence**: Presenting provides the opportunity to influence community thinking about tools, processes, libraries, and features.

**Giving back**: Sponsoring is a great way to support the community and be seen doing so.

### Value to employees as attendees or speakers:

**Better training**: Employees that attend are better informed about best practices and new features and tools.

**Better engagement**: Employees that attend have higher morale and are excited about applying what they've learned.

**Develop expertise**: Researching a topic for a presentation is a valuable learning experience.

**Better leaders**: Employees that participate as group speakers or organizers are learning leadership skills not always available in their regular roles.
