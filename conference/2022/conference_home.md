CppIndiaCon - The C++ festival of India is back!  

CppIndiaCon is India's premier International Conference hosted by [CppIndia](/_pages/about_us). CppIndia is excited to announce the 2nd edition of this International Conference on **6th August 2022**.

For our inaugural conference last year, we had talks from the greats of C++, including [Bjarne Stroustrup](/conference/2021/speakers/bjarne/), [Bryce Lelbach](/conference/2021/speakers/bryce/), and [Jon Kalb](/conference/2021/speakers/jonkalb/). Do check out the [CppIndiaCon 2021 Speakers](/conference/2021/speakers/speakers/).

For CppIndiaCon 2022 too, we have an exciting line-up of talks by [Inbal Levi](/conference/2022/speakers/inbal/), [Greg Law](/conference/2022/speakers/greg/), [Mahendra Garodi](/conference/2022/speakers/mahendra/), [Selvakumar Jawahar](/conference/2022/speakers/selvakumar/) and [Ankur Satle](/conference/2022/speakers/ankur/). Check out all about our favourite speakers on the [CppIndiaCon 2022 Speakers page](/conference/2022/speakers/speakers/).

## Registration

Like last year, CppIndiaCon 2022 shall be a **free online conference** despite the high quality talks from industry experts. Attending requires registration.

>To attend, please [register here](/conference/2022/CppIndiaCon-reg-form/){:target="_blank"}.

## Platform and Format

This **online conference** will be held over Zoom. The link for the all-day conference will be shared over email a few days before the conference. All talks will be held on the same Zoom event. You are suggested to install/update the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download){:target="_blank"} on your device ahead of time to avoid last-minute delay.

Networking and exchange will be done on Discord. Please sign-up and [join CppIndia Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Wz42tX5){:target="_blank"} when you register for the conference. To prevent last minute issues, please join the Discord server now.

## Schedule

This year's schedule has been improvised based on feedback from last year. As against six talks & AMAs in 2021, this year, we are going to have a single track of five talks. This enabled us to increase the Networking time between talks to 30-min, doubling it from CppIndiaCon 2021. The community shall greatly be benefitted by the intense topics at the tech-talks and the close networking opportunities that the conference brings.
